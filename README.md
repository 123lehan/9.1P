This project demonstrates the integration of a MongoDB database into a previously containerized Node.js calculator microservice, forming the core deliverable of SIT323 Task 9.1P – Cloud Native Application Development.The microservice, which performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, was extended to persistently store calculation results in MongoDB. Each calculation request sent to the API is logged in a MongoDB collection, and a dedicated endpoint (/history) allows retrieval of the full operation history, ensuring traceability and data persistence across sessions and restarts.The backend database, MongoDB, was deployed as a separate pod within the same Kubernetes cluster and exposed internally using a ClusterIP service. A Kubernetes Secret was used to securely store the MongoDB credentials, while a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) ensured that data remains intact even if the MongoDB pod restarts. This setup demonstrates how containerized applications can be reliably connected to stateful services within a cloud-native environment.

 I set up a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), using the gcloud command-line interface to authenticate and configure kubectl to interact with the cluster. Once the Kubernetes cluster was set up, I deployed the containerized application by creating Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files. The deployment defined the application’s desired state, while the service exposed the application to external traffic using a LoadBalancer.After deploying the application, I monitored the external IP provisioned by the Kubernetes service and confirmed that the application was accessible via this IP. Finally, I pushed all the necessary files, including the Dockerfile and Kubernetes configurations, to my GitHub repository  for version control. The process demonstrated how to effectively use Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Google Cloud services for hosting and managing the deployed application and also connectivity to the databse . By following these steps, I ensured that the application was fully operational on a cloud-based infrastructure.
