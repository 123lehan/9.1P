This project is part of SIT323 Task 9.1P – Cloud Native Application Development and demonstrates how to integrate a MongoDB database with a Dockerized calculator API. The Node.js microservice, initially capable of performing arithmetic operations, was extended to log each calculation into MongoDB for persistent storage. The full stack, including both the application and the database, was deployed to a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The microservice exposes several calculation endpoints (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication) via a RESTful API. All operations are stored in MongoDB and can be retrieved using the /history endpoint. This task showcases skills in containerization, Kubernetes deployment, environment variable management, and connecting cloud-native applications to persistent storage.


 I set up a Kubernetes cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), using the gcloud command-line interface to authenticate and configure kubectl to interact with the cluster. Once the Kubernetes cluster was set up, I deployed the containerized application by creating Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files. The deployment defined the application’s desired state, while the service exposed the application to external traffic using a LoadBalancer.

After deploying the application, I monitored the external IP provisioned by the Kubernetes service and confirmed that the application was accessible via this IP. Finally, I pushed all the necessary files, including the Dockerfile and Kubernetes configurations, to my GitHub repository (sit323-2025-prac6p) for version control. The process demonstrated how to effectively use Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Google Cloud services for hosting and managing the deployed application. By following these steps, I ensured that the application was fully operational on a cloud-based infrastructure.
